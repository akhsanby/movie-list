1. Using create-react-app
2. Get Movies from http://www.omdbapi.com/ Get API_KEY from http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx using fetch or axios allowed.
3. Simplied your react state into functional component using react-hooks applied (UseState, useEffect, useReducer).
4. Functional Component Based, details

- App.js — It will be the parent component for the other 3. It will also contain the function that handles the API request and it will have a function that calls the API during the component’s initial render.
- Header.js — A simple component that renders the app header and accepts a title prop
- Movie.js — It renders each movie. The movie object is simply passed into it as props.
- Search.js — Contains a form with the input element and the search button, contains functions that handle the input element and resets the field, and also contains a function that calls the search function which is passed as props to it.

It must be simple, so you must be careful with your syntax or code.Be Sure your app is suitable with the requirement above, because we do check your code/syntax with the requirement applied. So MAKE IT PERFECT !
